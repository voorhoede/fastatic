Each\nsection describes a built-in module or high-level concept.</p>\n<p>Where appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments\nprovided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic\nheading.</p>\n<p>Every <code>.html</code> document has a corresponding <code>.json</code> document presenting\nthe same information in a structured manner.  This feature is\nexperimental, and added for the benefit of IDEs and other utilities that\nwish to do programmatic things with the documentation.</p>\n<p>Every <code>.html</code> and <code>.json</code> file is generated based on the corresponding\n<code>.md</code> file in the <code>doc/api/</code> folder in Node.js&#39;s source tree.  The\ndocumentation is generated using the <code>tools/doc/generate.js</code> program.\nThe HTML template is located at <code>doc/template.html</code>.</p>\n<p>If you find an error in this documentation, please [submit an issue][]\nor see [the contributing guide][] for directions on how to submit a patch.</p>\n",

The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it\nmatures, certain parts are more reliable than others.  Some are so\nproven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at\nall.  Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous\nand in the process of being redesigned.</p>\n<p>The stability indices are as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 0 - Deprecated\nThis feature is known to be problematic, and changes are\nplanned.  Do not rely on it.  Use of the feature may cause warnings.  Backwards\ncompatibility should not be expected.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 1 - Experimental\nThis feature is subject to change, and is gated by a command line flag.\nIt may change or be removed in future versions.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 2 - Stable\nThe API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem\nis a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely necessary.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 3 - Locked\nOnly fixes related to security, performance, or bug fixes will be accepted.\nPlease do not suggest API changes in this area; they will be refused.\n</code></pre>\n"

Node functions which simply wrap a syscall,\nlike <code>fs.open()</code>, will document that. The docs link to the corresponding man\npages (short for manual pages) which describe how the syscalls work.</p>\n<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> some syscalls, like lchown(2), are BSD-specific. That means, for\nexample, that <code>fs.lchown()</code> only works on Mac OS X and other BSD-derived systems,\nand is not available on Linux.</p>\n<p>Most Unix syscalls have Windows equivalents, but behavior may differ on Windows\nrelative to Linux and OS X. For an example of the subtle ways in which it&#39;s\nsometimes impossible to replace Unix syscall semantics on Windows, see <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4760\">Node\nissue 4760</a>.</p>\n",
